"""Shared preview/confirm write state machine for Application Services.

Shared by Versions, Projects, and Memberships -- this project's own standing
"unify at the 3rd identical instance" convention (also applied to
`document_policy.py`/`news_policy.py`/`version_policy.py`).

`_finalize_write` performs no I/O itself: `commit` is a port-bound callable
supplied by the calling Service, since an Application Service must depend
only on a port's Protocol (never call transport directly). Only used by
domains with 2+ write actions sharing the same preview/commit/reject shape;
a domain with exactly one write method (e.g. Documents' update-only) stays a
single flat method instead -- a shared state machine for one call site would
be pure indirection, not reuse.

Both exported names are underscore-prefixed (not just the module) -- the
architecture-boundary test requires every public class under app/services/
to be named `*Service`/`*Resolver`; this module holds neither, so its
exports stay private the same way every per-Service copy it replaces did.

`gate_before_preview` (default False): three domains -- Group (create/update/
delete), Storage (create/update/delete), and User (delete only) -- have no
prior GET to authorize an unauthorized preview request against, so they check
`ensure_write_enabled` unconditionally, even for confirm=False, rather than
only inside the confirmed branch every other domain uses. This is a real,
audited, minority-but-recurring shape (OPM-2705), not a one-off bug: making
it an explicit parameter here keeps a single orchestration point for every
domain instead of forcing those three to hand-roll their own copy or forcing
every other domain to pay for a check it doesn't want. The gate still runs
after the validation_errors check would normally short-circuit -- these three
domains have no validation_errors/form concept at all (always called with
`validation_errors={}`), so ordering relative to that branch is moot for them
in practice.

`preview_detail` (default None): every `delete()` that needs to show the
about-to-be-deleted record in its preview response (Version, Board, Grid,
Membership, Meeting, Project, TimeEntry, WorkPackage, Storage) fetches that
record BEFORE the confirm branch (needed for scope/permission checks on the
target, independent of write-orchestration), then wants to surface it as
`result` on the preview response even though nothing was committed yet. This
is genuinely different from `commit`'s return value (which only exists on
the confirmed branch) -- passing the pre-fetched record through explicitly,
rather than threading it through `commit`, keeps `commit` a pure "do the
mutation" callable that's never invoked on a preview.
