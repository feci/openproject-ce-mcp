"""OPM-2706: "errors never leak credentials or internal details."

Verified directly against the code before writing these tests (not assumed):
the API token becomes an `Authorization: Basic ...` header once, at
`httpx.AsyncClient` construction time (`client.py`'s Settings-to-client
wiring) -- it is a default header on the client, never read back out of a
request or response afterward. `raise_for_status(status_code, payload)`
(`app/transport/errors.py`) and its only two call sites
(`app/transport/httpx_transport.py`) extract nothing but the parsed JSON
response BODY before mapping it to a typed exception; `response.request`/
`response.request.headers` (which would carry the Authorization header) are
never read on the error path. There is therefore no code path by which the
real API token could reach a raised exception's message -- testing for its
*absence* in some assembled string would be vacuous (it was never reachable
to begin with), so Test 1/Test 3 below prove that absence structurally
(no parameter exists to carry it) rather than by searching a haystack.

The one thing that DOES reach a raised exception verbatim is OpenProject's
own server-provided `message`/`_embedded.errors[].message` text
(`_combined_message`) -- Test 2 documents this honestly as current,
intentional-by-omission behavior (trusting a self-hosted instance's own
error text), not something this ticket redacts. See this module's own
`test_...passes_through_upstream_message_text_verbatim` docstring for why
redaction is a deliberate non-goal here, not an oversight.
